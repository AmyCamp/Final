Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	You say I'm always happy, and that I'm good at what I do, but what you'll never realize is, I'm a damn good actress too.

Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I want to be remembered as the girl who always smiled the one who could brighten up your day, even if she couldn't brighten her own.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	It's the loneliest feeling in the world - to find yourself standing up when everyone else is sitting down. To have everybody look at you and say "what's the matter with her?" I know what it feels like. Walking down an empty street, listening to the sound of your own footsteps. Shutters closed, blinds drawn, doors locked against you. And you aren't sure whether you're walking toward something, or if you're just walking away.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	You start life with a clean slate. Then you begin to make your mark. You face decisions, make choices. You keep moving forward. But sooner or later there comes a time where you look back over where you have been and wonder who you really are.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I don't know if I'm getting better or just used to the pain.

Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	It's like I realized that way down inside, I've always been lonely for something. But I don't know what for. It's like everybody in the world want's something. Only they never really know exactly what it is - they just keep finding out what it's not. You know how, when you turn off the TV or you come out of some concert, and everything just feels empty? Like you thought that would be what you wanted, and then it wasn't?
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	You look at me and think, 'she's so happy' but there's so much behind this little smile that you will never know.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Do you ever have those times you cry and you don't know why?
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	People are always telling me to smile, like smiling is going to just take away all the hurt and pain. Well I've tried that I've tried hiding my sorrows and covering the sadness in smiles and what I've learned is that when it hurts this much inside your heart always has a way of showing it no matter how many masks you wear.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Let no one think I gave in.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	The pain is there to remind me that I'm still alive.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	It seems to me that the harder I try the harder I fall.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Refuse to feel anything at all, refuse to slip, refuse to fall, can't be weak, can't stand still, watch your back because no one else will.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	There's no excuse for the need to take your own life away, everyone passes through some rough obstacles if life, just face them as they come along, there's always a way to overcome those obstacles, and learn from your experiences.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	If you can't solve it, it isn't a problemÂ - it's reality. And sometimes reality is the hardest thing to understand and the thing that takes the longest to realize. But once it hits you in the face you'll never forget it. It will always be there in your memories and sometimes that is the best way to look at it.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	It's funny the way you can get use to the tears and the pain.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	What do you do when you become too scared, too scared to live, too scared to die, too scared to love, too scared to even care?
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	You can't just hug me and say it's okay because right n... it doesn't feel that w...
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Sometimes the littlest thing in life changes something forever and there will be times when you wish you can go back to how things used to be but you just can't because things have changed so much.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I just wish I could roll back the clocks to when things were the same... then we were all just a bunch of crazy teenagers looking for a wild time. But now, thing aren't the same. Each of us have gone our different ways. We change, people change, things just change, and we aren't those crazy teenagers looking for a wild time anymore. We're teenagers looking for a person to love and a person to hug when we're in need.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Sometimes I think that if I wasn't so good at pretending to be, I'd be better at actually being happy.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Her sadness did not have that. It dripped slowly into her life without her noticing it, at least, not noticing it until it consumed her fully and smothered her with darkness.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I quit, I give up, nothing's good enough for anybody else, it see... when Im all alone it's best way to be. When I'm by myself nobody else can say good-bye. Everything is temporary anyway.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Everybody's searching for a hero. People need someone to look up to. I never found anyone who fulfilled my need... a lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Pain is your friend, it tells you when you're seriously injured, it keeps you awake and angry but the best thing about it is it lets you know that you're alive.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I have a tendency to hurt myself physically, when I'm hurting inside.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	When your sure you've had enough of this life... don't let yourself go... because everybody cries... everybody hurts sometimes... sometimes everything is wrong.Some of us are just trying to get through the day without falling apart.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Every night before I go to sleep I lie on my bed and stare up at my blank walls. I try to imagine the future, but right now it's as blank as those walls. All I can see is a past that I barely recognize any more.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I don't want the world to see me, because I don't think that they'd understand.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Look at me. You may think you see who I really am, but you'll never know me.

Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I'm often silent when I am screaming inside.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	The deepest people are the ones who've been hurt the most.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Someone once asked me, 'Why do you always insist on taking the hard road?' I replied, 'Why do you assume I see two roads?'
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Wear a mask that grins and lies, it hides our cheeks and shades our eyes. The debt we pay to human guile, with torn and broken hearts, we smile.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Sometimes I feel like nobody has held me down and forced me to cry or made me hug them, or seen to the inside of me. I just say 'oh I'm fine' and walk away. Nobody's ever said to me 'no you're not'.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Do you ever get that feeling where you don't want to talk to anybody? You don't want to smile and you don't want to fake being happy. But at the same time you don't know exactly what's wrong either. There isn't a way to explain it to someone who doesn't already understand. If you could want anything in the world it would be to be alone. People have stopped being comforting and being along never was. At least when you're alone no one will constantly ask you what is wrong and there isn't anyone who won't take 'I don't know' for an answer. You feel the way you do just because. You hope the feeling will pass soon and that you will be able to be yourself again, but until then all you can do is wait.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Some people try to understand, but nobody can know what living like this is like.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	You never know when you wake up, if all will be the same, or if you'll be back in your dark place, again to feel the pain.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	No one can see the pain what we hide, they're happy for us to keep it inside, our fear is our own; they don't want to know. Why should we involve them; why should it show.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Our generation has had no Great war, no Great Depression. Our war is spiritual. Our depression is our lives.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	So drop the little razor, and pick up your life, forget all the bad things, the pain and the strife.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I'm not my usual self being quiet and lonely isn't 'me' crying all night, acting all day this isn't how it's supposed to be.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I'm hurting so bad inside I just wish you could see... I'm struggling to be someone that isn't even close to me.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Beware the person who has nothing to lose.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	In the end, music is your only friend.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	When your going thru hell... it's best to just keep on going...
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	What's the point in screaming? No ones listening anyway.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I'm young and I'm hopeless... I'm lost and I know this... I'm going nowhere fast... that's what they say... I'm troublesome, I've fallen... I'm angry at my Father... it's me against this world and I don't care.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	She's not the kind of girl who likes to tell the world about the way she feels about herself.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Did it surprise you that I am not who you thought I was? Did it surprise you to find that I don't exactly stand for what you thought I stood for all along? Did it surprise you to find that I'm not exactly how I played myself out to be? That the person you thought I was is actually nothing to what I am.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Everyone sees who I appear to be but only a few know the real me, you only see what I choose to show there's so much behind my smile you just don't know.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I like having low self-esteem it makes me feel special.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Take it from someone who's fallen... it's a long way down.

Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Reality has exiled me; I am no longer bound by it's laws.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Sometimes you can cry until there is nothing left wet in you. You can scream and curse to where your throat rebels and ruptures.

Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I can't get my wrists to bleed, just don't know why suicide appeals to me. - Alice Cooper
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	This isn't a perfect world. People do get hurt. You smile when you feel like crying. You act like you're ok, when you're falling apart inside. And you try to let go, you try to move on, because you know there's nothing else you could do.

We come from all walks of life and can be any age. We are every single race or religion that you can possibly think of. Our common link is this: We are in pain. We self-injure. And we are not freaks.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	You see her sitting there and you think 'shes so sad' but its not that shes sad, shes simply given up on pretending to be happy, shes tired of getting up every morning and putting on her fake smile, telling herself 'today will be better'.

Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	In reality, I'm slowly losing my mind. Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside. Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly. Cause I donâ€™t want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering. So I wear my disguise till I go home at night and turn down all the lights and then I break down and cry.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Everyone is asking me how I feel, how I am and truthly I feel numb. I cant feel anything and honestly I like it.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Depression is such a strong emotion, its regret, fear, frustration, isolation, a choice, and sometimes even a form of protection. ~ Never_the_star
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Loneliness is the human condition. No one is ever going to fill that space. -White Oleander
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Why don't you just sit down, close your eyes and invent your own world? When you were little you did, even with your eyes open.
Love	Love doesn't make things easier... just worth it.
Love	You are everything I never knew I wanted.
Love	I don't say I love you to hear it back, I say it so you don't forget.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Sometimes it seems like we're all living in some kind of prison, and the crime is how much we all hate ourselves. It's good to get really dressed up once in a while and admit the truth - that when you look closely, people are so strange and complicated that they're actually beautiful. Possibly even me.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	As long as you know everything is a lie then you can't hurt yourself.- Manson
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Do you ever have one of those days where nothing really goes wrong but you feel like you hate the world and the smallest thing that happens can make you break down right there and cry?
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Cutters are living proof that when the body is ravaged the soul cries out and when the soul is trampled upon, the body bleeds.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I'm playing a game I can't win, I keep losing and losing, why do I keep playing? To me it isn't about winning or losing, I'm just enjoying the game.
Love	At first you didn't mean much to me but now you're all I need.
Love	Whats meant to be will always find a way.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	The drastic steps I'm taking are just an act of desperation, no one's gonna miss me so what the hell. I fought and lied I drank too much. Hurt everyone I ever touched, just how much I hurt you is hard to tell. It's not some kind of cry for help just good bye I wish you well because I love you I'm gonna kill myself. --- Tim McGraw
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I won't leave a note for anyone to find tomorrow they will know what I've done here tonight. --- Tim McGraw
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Do you ever lay in bed at night hoping you wake up in the emergency room and hear the words "shes not going to make it?"
Love	True love cannot be found where it doesn't exist, nor can it be hidden where it does.
Love	The truest test of love is if you're willing to keep fighting for it.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I certainly didn't tell anyone; I didn't advertise that I was doing this, but I didn't necessarily also make sure no one could see that I was injured. In fact, I felt proud of it; I felt good about it. It was like a battle scar: it proved that I had been grievously wounded and survived. When I hid my scars, I did so because I didn't want anyone to think I was a basket case or a mental case and to look down on me or to pity me or to stop hanging out with me - leave me because they couldn't. handle me...
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	You know when you cut yourself really badly, it doesn't hurt at all for awhile you don't feel anything - death, our reaction to death is sort of like that you don't feel anything at all and then later on you begin to hurt.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Pull the shades - razor blades - you're so tragic. i hate you so but love you more. i'm so elastic - the things you say - games you play - dirty magic.Â  --- The Offspring
Love	Don't push your relationship with a person too hard, if its meant to be then it will happen.
Love	Sometimes, when you imagine a perfect guy, you realize you've described a person you've known forever.
Love	Have you ever hated someone so much that you they would just leave and never come back... but yet, loved them so much, you knew you'd die if they did?
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I did not, you see, want to kill myself. Not at that time, anyway. But I wanted to know that if need be, if the desperation got so terribly bad, I could inflict harm on my body. And I could. Knowing this gave me a sense of peace and power, so I started cutting up my legs all the time. Hiding the scars from my mother became a sport of its own. I collected razor blades, I bought a Swiss Army knife, I became fascinated with different kinds of sharp edges and the different cutting sensations they produced. I tried out different shapes - squares, triangles, pentagons, even an awkwardly carved heart, with a stab wound at its center, wanting to see if it hurt the way a real broken heart could hurt. I was amazed and pleased to find that it didn't. ---Â  Prozac Nation
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Let me give you some advice-- if you are gonna lie about something at least make sure it's worth lying about.
Love	No matter what you are to the rest of the world, you are everything to me.
Love	If you love someone more then anything, then distance only matters to the mind, not to the heart.
Love	I believe that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I've always been the good girl. The girl whose parents that she would grow up and actually become something. But I'm not like that anymore. I never thought I'd drink or snort those pills but I guess I was wrong. Now that I've done it I don't wanna stop. It's like cutting, once you drag that blade across your skin you can't stop. You don't wanna stop. I know you wanted a perfect teenage girl but in reality there isn't one.
Love	Love means never having to say you're sorry.
Love	Love is missing someone whenever you're apart, but some how feeling warm inside because you're close in heart.
Love	When I first saw you I was afraid to talk to you. When I first talked to you I was afraid to like you. When I first liked you I was afraid to love you.Now that I love you I'm afraid to loss you.
Love	I don't want anyone else to realize how amazing you are.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	First time I cut was just to feel the pain, Strange because I didn't feel a thing.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	It wasn't because I wanted to die, I just wanted the pain to finally stop.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I have to cut because it's the only way I can smile.
Love	Everyday that goes by it seems like I discover something new about you to love it's incredible to me how one person can make such a big difference in my life, you touch me in a way no one else ever has and gave me so many reasons to love you.
Love	Because of you... I laugh a little harder, cry a little less, and smile a little more.
Love	When the angels ask what I loved most about life, I'll say you.
Love	Love is not who you can see yourself with. It is who you can't see yourself without.
Love	I might not get to see you as often as I'd like, I may not get to hold you in my arms at night, but deep in my heart I know that it's true. No matter what happens... I'll always love you.
Love	If you truely love someone, you'll frogive the unforgivable.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Close your eyes, and imagine 5, 10, 15 years from now. You are with your husband and maybe 2, 3 or so kids and your a very happy family, and very self-full-filled and your life is perfect just the way you had always dreamed and hoped, and then your little 5 year old child asks you: "mommy, why do you have all those white scars on your arm?" and then what will you say? I used to take a razor and pull it down real slow and carefully and watch the blood drop out of my skin so that I could see that I am still alive, or so I could feel real physical pain instead of emotional pain. No you can't say that to yourÂ child. and even if you do then your child will learn from you and do the same to themselves when ever they are feeling down. you don't really want that now do you.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	What you think is what you are. what you peruse becomes your reality. ---Babylon_11
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	You ask why I say nothings wrong when really everything is. You should know what wrong. Your my friends, your making bad decions and its killing me to see you suffer like you are. You just never see how what your doing effects me because you donâ€™t care enough to look and see. ---FastTurtle
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I cry then I cut, then I cry again, it never ends.--- TeraI was lost. There was nobody for me to talk to about all that you were troubling me with. So I sat alone, with everything inside, and cried myself to sleep.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	when you talk about feelings, words were too stiff, they were this and not that, they couldn't include all the meanings. In defining, they always left something out.--- White Oleander

Love	Don't give up on love, because there is always soemone who loves you... even if it's not the person you were hoping for.
Love	No matter how ugly you think you are, that special person that loves you believes you are the most beautiful and irresistible thing on earth and nothing can ever change that.
Love	I love you not because you are perfect, but because you are so perfect for me.
Love	If you love someone put there name in a circle instead of a heart because hearts can break but circles go on forever.
Love	Today, if a smile comes to you, a happy smile the perhaps you can't explain, it's because at that moment, I am thinking of you and smiling too!
Love	There are only two times I wanna be with you... Now and forever!
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I only smile in the dark.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Every so often I want to dig my fingernails underneath my skin and peel off the face everybody's so used to seeing me in. Every so often I want people to know that I'm not as okay as they think I am. --- onceuponatime
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	It wasn't a suicide attempt, it was an escape from everything awful. When we cut, we're in control - we make our own pain and we can stop it whenever we want. Physical pain relieves mental anguish. For a brief moment, the pain of cutting is the only thing in the cutter's mind, and when that stops and the other comes back, it is weaker. Drugs do that too, and sex, but not like cutting. Nothing is like cutting.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	To be loved to madness - such was her great desire. Love was to her the one cordial that could drive away the eating loneliness of her days.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	These cuts are leaving creases. Trace the scars, to fit the pieces, to tell your story, you don't need to say a word.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Who am I? I am who I say I am and tomorrow someone else entirely.
Love	You know it's right when no matter what you're doing or what kind of mood your in the thought of him can make you smile.

Love	One time someone asked me, "Do you think it's possable to love a person forever?" At first I didn't know what to say, but then I looked at you, I knew it was true, so I simply replied, "Forever isn't long enough.".
Love	I love you... don't ever think that I don't, and don't ever forget that I do.
Love	When you held me in your arms, I wanted nothing more then to hold you forever.
Love	I do believe that God above, created you for me to love, He picked you out among the rest, because He knows I'd love you best!
Love	We are all a little weird, life's a little weird, and when we find soemone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and call it love.
Love	It's easier to fake love, then to hide it.
Love	You make me smile for no reason what so ever, you make me laugh at the unfunnest things, but most of all you make me love you when I shouldn't be loving you.
Love	I hug you and I almost feel like that's where I belong, and honestly, that's the only place I want to be.
Love	When you love them they drive you crazy because they know they can.
Love	Why I love you is a hard question to answer. I love you because you care for me like no one else I know. I love the way I feel in your arms, so safe from dangers in the world. I love your eyes, so hypnotic and mesmerizing, beautiful to gaze into, and yet never revealing everything to me. I can explain every way that I love you because thats in possible. But I can say I love you because I you are you.
Love	Why is it that everyone looks at him and doesn't see how wonderful he is?
Love	Because I saw it the first time I laid eyes on him.
Love	You only think that youre immune to feelings. The most unlikely person could reduce you to tears, laughter, or spontaneous declarations of love.
Love	Love is missing someone whenever you're apart, but some how feeling warm inside because you're close in heart.

Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I'm not afraid of the gun in my hand, I'm not afraid of dying, I'm just afraid of the pain it will bring, and to see my best friends crying.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Are you running away from something you don't want? Or running away from something you're afraid to want?
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	I wear my scars proudly. They represent the battles through which I have gone, and I am proud because those battles I have won.
Love	There are only two times I wanna be with you... Now and forever!

Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	Damaged people are dangerous, they know they know they can survive.
Depression_Suicide_Self_Injury	People dislike alcoholics, but they still drink at parties. People sit in non-smoking section in restaurants, but still enjoy the occasional nicotine jolt. People have strong feelings against self-injurers, but they also take all their emotions out on other people.
